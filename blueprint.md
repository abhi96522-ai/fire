# Project: Arduino Cloud UI Clone

## Overview

This project aims to replicate the user interface of the Arduino Cloud website. The development will be iterative, starting with the main landing page and progressively adding more features and pages.

## Current Plan: Initial Landing Page

The goal for this iteration is to create the static landing page, focusing on the main visual elements.

### Steps:

1.  **Create the basic HTML structure (`index.html`)**:
    *   Header with logo and navigation.
    *   Hero section with a headline and call-to-action.
    *   Main content area.
    *   Footer.
2.  **Style the page (`style.css`)**:
    *   Apply a color scheme, typography, and layout similar to the Arduino Cloud website.
    *   Ensure the page is responsive.
3.  **Add JavaScript for basic interactivity (`main.js`)**:
    *   Implement a mobile navigation menu toggle.
